## Description

This is just a code quiz application that I wrote using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Key Features

- Test your JavaScript coding knowledge.
- Boasts a responsive design. This quiz looks good on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.

## Usage

Click the start button to start the timed quiz. You have 75 seconds and each question is multiple choice. Click each answer button to submit your answer, but be aware that wrong answers subtract 10 seconds from your time. Once you reach the end, your score is the amount of time that you have left. Then, submit your initials and score.

- JavaScript

## Concepts Demonstrated

- General HTML/CSS/JavaScript syntax and purpose.
- JavaScript timers using setInterval().
- JavaScript event handlers.
- Adding and removing HTML elements using the DOM.
